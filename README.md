### üß† How It Works
The process includes:
1. **Face Detection**: The app uses MTCNN to detect faces in the uploaded image.
2. **Feature Extraction**: ResNet50 (without the top layer) is used to extract features from the face.
3. **Cosine Similarity**: The extracted features are compared with the celebrity dataset using cosine similarity to find the closest match.

#### Model Structure
- **ResNet50**: Used to extract facial features.
- **MTCNN**: Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks for accurate face detection.
